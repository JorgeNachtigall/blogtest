Hi!

After a long time without touching this project I'm back. A lot of things had happened in my life in the past months. I've
completed my computer science degree (yeah, I'm very happy) and I've been selected on a master degree program on my university!!!

So, after all those things I've decided to come back to this project, although I've a lot to do. 

For now all I've to say about the project is that I've fixed the pixel perfect problem that I had on the "previous version".

To acomplish this all I had to is apply this formula that I've found on the internet:

The camera size on unity needs to be = the height of the screen resolution / PPU (pixels per unit from the imported images) / 2

This get me the cool look that you can see on the gif below:

And that's pretty much it. This was a problem that was making me lose the desire to continue the project, but now it's gone and I'm happy to start things over again =)

I will not establish "next eteps" because I need to think more about what I want to implement for now, but I will come back soon!

See ya! =)
