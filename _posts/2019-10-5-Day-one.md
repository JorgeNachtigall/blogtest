Hello!

I've finished the first development day of HabbUnity.

To start, I've created the room floor generator. You can enter the dimensions of the room and, as you can see in the gif, it will be created in run-time.
I've also created the cursor selector to identify wich floor block are you selecting.

I'm having some problems with pixel perfect rendering on Unity, I'm not satisfied with the image quality and i'm afraid that gets worse when I start adding movement in the game (from furnis and players).

Those rendering problems was affecting the floor sprite too much, so I've used the tilemap implementation of Unity and this become much more acceptable.

The next step is:
- Create player movement using A* algorithm.

For now I will not think in multiplayer solutions, so all will be done client-side, but the plans are to use socket.io (that I already have experience) to manage the packages and maybe use nodeJS to server-side.

Thanks!
