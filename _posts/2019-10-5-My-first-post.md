title: Starting Development!
---

Hi! My name is Jorge Nachtigall, I'm an computer scient student at Federal University of Pelotas. I've started this blog to show the development of my project: HabbUnity.

When I was a child I've spend a lot of time playing Habbo Hotel and always had an special love about this game.

Now as an developer I've decided to start this projet on Unity and try to recreate Habbo Hotel (at least something like it) in this game engine.

This will be an life project. I have no hurry to finish, so everything will be done in my free time and with no rush.

If you have any questions, suggestions or just want to share your thoughts you can use the comments section.

That's it, let's see what it will become =)
